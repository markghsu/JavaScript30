    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const bloop = [...players];
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const shallow = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    shallow.push('dumb');
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copyarr = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newarr = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const spreader = [...players];

    const pp = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    newarr.push('newarr');
    copyarr.push('copyarr');
    spreader.push('spreader');
    players.push('original');
    console.log(newarr);
    console.log(copyarr);
    console.log(spreader);
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const newObj = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newAssignObj = Object.assign({},person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const newSpread = {...person};
    newAssignObj['nwr'] = 'bowowo';
    newSpread['tolker'] = 'dkd';
    newObj['woops'] = 'not a copy';
    console.log(newAssignObj);
    console.log(newSpread);
    console.log(newObj);
    console.log(person);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
